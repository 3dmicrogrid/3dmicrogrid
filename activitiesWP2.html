                <p class='justyfied'>The 3D-Mgrid project will establish a website aligned with the project’s specific objectives. This website will serve as the primary repository of the project information, including project public reports, inventories and analyses. The website will also announce forthcoming project opportunities, highlight relevant news items, report publication activity through the submission of scientific papers in specialized reviews and conferences, and links to other relevant services/initiatives. The web site will be set up by Month 4.</p>

                <p class="justyfied">The workshops (50 attendees expected) will possibly be synchronized with related events and conferences, and will include a primary focus on 3D-Mgrid activities in a wider scope. Plenary presentations and group discussions will privilege presentation and sharing of real experiences and best practices. The exchanges, internships, and student grants will support knowledge / technology sharing and building research communities. Finally, the comprehensive presentation of the project results can best be achieved through the organization of a final 3D-Mgrid conference.</p>
                <p class="justyfied">Exchange visits, internships, and student grants will be presented and discussed in PMB meetings, addressing the strength and the ways to continue, adapt and/or improve the activities during the rest of the project.</p>
