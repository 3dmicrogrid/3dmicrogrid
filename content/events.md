title: Energynautics at Hybrid Power Systems Workshop in Tenerife
date:27 / 06 / 2018
text:

Recently, our partner Energynautics attented to the Hybrid Workshop at Tenerife showing to the audience the project latest news. The workshop participants made good use of this unique opportunity to discuss the challenges that arise when high shares of renewables (wind, solar, hydro) are integrated into island power systems/micro-grids, in combination with conventional power generators and optionally batteries/flywheels. Finding viable combinations of conventional and renewable energy is one key solution for the efficient and sustainable running of these types of power systems.

These international experts convened to share their project experiences and to detect areas in need of improvement. With a total of 14 sessions and more than 50 presentations the spectrum of topics included in the Workshop ranged from hybrid system technologies and system modelling/simulation to intelligent control and grid stabilization as well as Mini-/Micro-Grid system design. Storage issues were covered as well as economic issues.

Beside the regular sessions the workshop also offered great networking opportunities like the Workshop Dinner at the conference venue, poster sessions and a study trip to the Institute of Technology and Renewable Energies (ITER).

title:PhD Student from AGU hosted at CERTH/ITI 
date:07 / 03 / 2018

CERTH/ITI had the pleasure to host Ms. Yeliz Yoldaş, a PhD student from the Abdullah Gul University (AGU, Kayseri, Turkey), as part of the Young Researchers mobility aspect in the 3DMicroGrid project. During her visit, the Secondary control level of the 3DMicroGrid control architecture has been defined in detail along with the optimization algorithms and full functionalities for the project’s Use Cases. Through iterative and interactive meetings and technical discussions about the 3DMicroGrid Centralised Controller, a novel optimization model has been drafted, and will be implemented from AGU in the following months. It was a fruitful experience for both parties and most promising research results are expected from this close collaboration.

title:9th International IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference.
date:29 / 01 / 2018
text:

The 3DMicroGrid project participated in the 9th International IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, that took place on 8-10 November 2017, in Bangalore, India (http://ieee-appeec2017.org). As representative, Angelina Bintoudi from CERTH/ITI, presented orally the project’s conceptual hierarchical agent-based control design for AC microgrids, in the context of a paper titled “Novel Hybrid Design For Microgrid Control”. The main functionalities and benefits that are expected to derive from the 3DMicroGrid architecture were detailed and later on discussed with the audience. During Q&A, the control architecture received constructive feedback and positive comments from academia and research community, notably about its inherit increased reliability as it derives from its ability to reconfigure in case of central controller failure.

title:Seville's 3DMicrogrid Workshop: Smart Microgrid Design.
date:23 / 11 / 2017
text:

From the 8th to the 10th of November, the University of Seville held the project's workshop about design of smart microgrids. Along the first day, assistants attended to [high-level lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-RUkSB6cbPA8C-GHIs3uxA/videos) concerning the workshop main topics and real real cases' experience. 

Following the [event's agenda](http://www.3dmicrogrid.com/downloads.html), the project's work packages evolution was addressed as technical discussions about microgrid's performance and modelling took place. The host university made a demostration of their scale microgrid and shown its low-temperature thermal plant at the building roof to the assistants, which were really pleased and interested indeed.

Finally, the future meetings and events were considered, focusing on the project's-related papers, publications and sessions' repercussion.
