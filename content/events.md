From the 8th to the 10th of November, the University of Seville held the project's workshop about design of smart microgrids. Along the first day, assistants attended to [high-level lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-RUkSB6cbPA8C-GHIs3uxA/videos) concerning the workshop main topics and real real cases' experience. 

Following the [event's agenda](http://www.3dmicrogrid.com/downloads.html), the project's work packages evolution was addressed as technical discussions about microgrid's performance and modelling took place. The host university made a demostration of their scale microgrid and shown its low-temperature thermal plant at the building roof to the assistants, which were really pleased and interested indeed.

Finally, the future meetings and events were considered, focusing on the project's-related papers, publications and sessions' repercussion.

title:3DMigroGrid's Press Release
date:25 / 05 / 2017
text:
Recently our official press release has been published, with lots of information regarding the project's aim, its impact, development and more. While reading the release you will find some of our team members explaining how the 3DMicroGrid may change the involved campuses and their relevance.

Here it is an extract of the press release:

"Experts from leading institutions in Greece, Germany, Spain, Cyprus, Malta, Jordan, Turkey, and Algeria are leading a new evolution in the future smart micro-grid systems. They are meeting at CERTH as part of the activities of the3DMicroGrid project that is supported by the European Commission through the ERANETMED Initiative Programme. The project aims to facilitate the design, development and demonstration of an active smart micro-grid system to integrate and optimise multiple small to medium sized energy sources and loads."
