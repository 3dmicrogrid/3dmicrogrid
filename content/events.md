title:PhD Student from AGU hosted at CERTH/ITI 
date:07 / 03 / 2018

CERTH/ITI had the pleasure to host Ms. Yeliz Yoldaş, a PhD student from the Abdullah Gul University (AGU, Kayseri, Turkey), as part of the Young Researchers mobility aspect in the 3DMicroGrid project. During her visit, the Secondary control level of the 3DMicroGrid control architecture has been defined in detail along with the optimization algorithms and full functionalities for the project’s Use Cases. Through iterative and interactive meetings and technical discussions about the 3DMicroGrid Centralised Controller, a novel optimization model has been drafted, and will be implemented from AGU in the following months. It was a fruitful experience for both parties and most promising research results are expected from this close collaboration.

Recently Dr Ing. Brian Azzopardi and Ms. Renata Mikalauskiene from MCAST Energy Research Group (MCAST Energy) presented two posters at the 27th International Photovoltaic Science and Engineering Conference (PVSEC-27), Japan related with 3DMgrid project:

1. ANALYSIS OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS OPERATING AT MCAST CAMPUS, MALTA
2. A FUTURE-PROOF PILOT MICROGRID ENHANCING THE INTEGRATION OF PV GENERATION: 3DMicroGrid PROJECT
    
3DMGrid project: Design, Development and Demonstration of a future-proof active Smart MicroGrid system is partly funded by the Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST) is also locally partnered with ESDL Ltd. and GEOSYS Ltd. among a consortium of 10 partners from Jordan, Spain, Germany, Greece and Cyprus. 
The MCAST Energy Research Group (MCAST Energy), led by Dr Inġ. Brian Azzopardi, Principal Investigator (PI), leads the Energy Research Theme at MCAST. The group specialises in global and regional solutions by innovative devices in emerging technologies, systems level integration to policy engagement for better community. The breath of energy research at MCAST includes Device Fabrication and on-site Testing, Energy Economics and Policy, Efficient Buildings, Power Systems, Renewables and Transportation. The group specialises in applied research techniques including but not limited to optimisation, decision making and life cycle analysis. 
This breadth of research at MCAST Energy is supported by the Malta Council of Science and Technology (MCST) through the ERANETMED initiative of Mediterranean Partner Countries for 3DMgrid project.

title:9th International IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference.
date:29 / 01 / 2018
text:

The 3DMicroGrid project participated in the 9th International IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, that took place on 8-10 November 2017, in Bangalore, India (http://ieee-appeec2017.org). As representative, Angelina Bintoudi from CERTH/ITI, presented orally the project’s conceptual hierarchical agent-based control design for AC microgrids, in the context of a paper titled “Novel Hybrid Design For Microgrid Control”. The main functionalities and benefits that are expected to derive from the 3DMicroGrid architecture were detailed and later on discussed with the audience. During Q&A, the control architecture received constructive feedback and positive comments from academia and research community, notably about its inherit increased reliability as it derives from its ability to reconfigure in case of central controller failure.

title:Seville's 3DMicrogrid Workshop: Smart Microgrid Design.
date:23 / 11 / 2017
text:

From the 8th to the 10th of November, the University of Seville held the project's workshop about design of smart microgrids. Along the first day, assistants attended to [high-level lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-RUkSB6cbPA8C-GHIs3uxA/videos) concerning the workshop main topics and real real cases' experience. 

Following the [event's agenda](http://www.3dmicrogrid.com/downloads.html), the project's work packages evolution was addressed as technical discussions about microgrid's performance and modelling took place. The host university made a demostration of their scale microgrid and shown its low-temperature thermal plant at the building roof to the assistants, which were really pleased and interested indeed.

Finally, the future meetings and events were considered, focusing on the project's-related papers, publications and sessions' repercussion.

title:3DMigroGrid's Press Release
date:25 / 05 / 2017
text:
Recently our official press release has been published, with lots of information regarding the project's aim, its impact, development and more. While reading the release you will find some of our team members explaining how the 3DMicroGrid may change the involved campuses and their relevance.

Here it is an extract of the press release:

"Experts from leading institutions in Greece, Germany, Spain, Cyprus, Malta, Jordan, Turkey, and Algeria are leading a new evolution in the future smart micro-grid systems. They are meeting at CERTH as part of the activities of the3DMicroGrid project that is supported by the European Commission through the ERANETMED Initiative Programme. The project aims to facilitate the design, development and demonstration of an active smart micro-grid system to integrate and optimise multiple small to medium sized energy sources and loads."
