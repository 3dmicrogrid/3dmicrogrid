                  The German-Jordanian University is a public university. It was founded in 2005 by a Royal Decree, in
accordance with a memorandum of understanding reached between the Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Federal Ministry of Education and
Research of the Federal Republic of Germany. GJU is modeled on the German applied-sciences model,
characterized by its focus on putting knowledge into practice and on promoting knowledge transfer. It aims to
play a significant role in promoting links between Jordan and Europe, and in particular with Germany.

                  UCY is the first public university and the main research institution in Cyprus and has demonstrated a rich
research activity in power systems, power electronics and renewable energy sources. This project will be
implemented by the KIOS Research Center (www.kios.ucy.ac.cy), which was established in 2008 and has
attracted more than 10 million euros in research funding from European, national and industrial sources. The
UCY team is expert in the control of power electronic converters for RES, power system reliability and
quality, grid-integration of RES, and optimization techniques. Outcomes from other research projects running at UCY (e.g., ZeroCO2, HYBRID, SyncPower and ADVANCEDGRIDS, FAULT-ADAPTIVE ERC Advanced
Grant) will contribute to the project.

                 ENERGYNAUTICS, founded in 2000, is a power systems consultancy firm based in Germany. It has been
involved in numerous research and consulting projects for governments, electricity network operators,
regulators, manufacturers and investors, especially in matters relating to innovative grid design and power
system integration of renewable energies. In the context of this proposal, the Danish Cell Project is the most
relevant reference. It was financed by the Danish TSO Energinet.dk and focused on the integration of
renewable energy into island/power systems involving the development of new control approaches including
field tests in Denmark. It consists of micro-grids within a distribution network which allow the operation of
wind turbines, photovoltaic systems and small combined heat and power plants in electrical islands.

Abdullah Gul University (AGU) is the first state university in Turkey to have, as part of its constitution, legal
provision for support by a foundation whose entire efforts are solely dedicated to the work of the University.
AGU has set itself the aim of attracting brilliant faculty members and the brightest students. All the academic
work of the University is in English. Graduates of AGU will be typified by the ability to learn, to think, to
research, and to lead.
In all academic programs, there are practical elements as well as conscious attempts to connect theoretical
knowledge with the real world; the university will aim to produce not employment seekers but employees and
even employers. One of the strongest research areas in AGU is power systems, specifically smart grids.
There are 5 faculties actively working in this field along with their graduate students. The areas of interest
are: power system reliability, renewable integration, power system communication, electrical machines and
power electronics, and smart grid communication.

AGU will focus on operating scenarios, renewable energy integration and optimization based on grid
efficiency, reliability and economy. It will also work on modelling of the grid and develop algorithms to obtain
maximum benefit. In evaluation part, AGU will focus on metrics for utilities, energy suppliers, stakeholder and
customers. AGU will also collaborate in the dynamic optimization part of allocation of renewable sources
based on the time varying nature of loads.
