                <p class='justyfied'>This task will deal with the definition of the various operation scenarios (detailed high level Use Cases and expected outcomes per application scenario) that will be drafted early in the project lifetime for validating and evaluating the proposed micro-grid concept and tools.A wide range of characteristics (RES integration and generation load demand, security and efficiency issues, market price and bid, level of stored energy, etc.) will be taken into consideration [A] in the business scenarios and the use cases to be demonstrated in the foreseen real-life pilot.</p>
                <p class='justyfied'>Project Fact Sheet: a project fact brochure will be produced, made available online and printed for dissemination. A revised version will be prepared at months 12, 24 and 36 in order to include substantial results. Posters will be printed as well and used at events.</p>
                <p class='justyfied'>3D-Mgrid Regional Collaboration Booklet: a booklet entitled “Long Term Regional Collaboration in Smart Micro Grids” will be produced at the end of the project based on the outcomes of project activities. The booklet will provide guidance and recommendations for long-term regional collaboration in Smart Micro Grids.</p>
                <p class='justyfied'>e-Newsletter: a concise e-Newsletter will be published on a semi-annual basis and circulated to key stakeholders in the field. The e-Newsletter will draw reader’s attention to new material published on the website, and will also publish highlights of the reports as well as general project news, event announcements, or invitations to participate in surveys.</p>

Lessons are learned during project work, testing and integration, and as a part of evaluation of prototypes. From the LL and from validation of pilots, together with technology and market reports, a set of new and/or updated requirements will be extracted. Additionally, the impact on the future development will be evaluated, described and reported in D3.3 .</p>

                <p class='justyfied'>In this task, innovative algorithms and techniques for automatically extracting micro-grid performance related patterns, based on light weight / non-intrusive multi-sensorial framework as well as the requirement list provided by T3.2 & T3.3, will be designed and developed. An efficient combination of evidence from multiple modalities (multi-sensorial network) will be used, joined by additional important information for the proper function of the micro-grid (load demand and RES generation forecasts, market price, stored energy, etc). Micro-grid Performance Models will be trained and fine-tuned based on real-life evidence. The main goal of this task will be to deliver holistic Micro-grid Performance Models, which will help to better understand the behaviour of the micro-grid, and suggest innovative performance profiles and efficient methodologies, in order to succeed the optimal operation of the micro-grid, in terms of efficiency, reliability and economy. The models delivered in this task will be utilized by WP4 components, such as Tasks 4.1 and 4.3</p>
